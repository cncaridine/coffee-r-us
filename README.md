# The Coffee Spot  

## Creator:
Cori Caridine

## Site: https://the-coffee-spot-512.herokuapp.com/coffee/

## Approach:
The MVC (Models, Views, Controllers) file structure was used to create an one model with all 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD. The online store app was deployed online via Heroku to allow for public access.

## Problem:
Limited platform for high school students to show case their hand-made pottery, specifically mugs.

## Purpose:
The app provides a platform to showcase students' artistic skills and use the proceeds to donate to local nonprofits.

## Targeted Users:
Coffee mugs lovers and/or art lovers.

## Unsolved Problems/Additional Functionality:
Add a functioning shopping cart. Adjust the styling for website design to better reflect the mobile design. Create equal sized divs.

###  *HTML
###  *CSS
###  *JavaScript
###  *jQuery
###  *Node.js
###  *Mongoose
