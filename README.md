# The Coffee Spot  

## Creator: Cori Caridine

## Site: https://the-coffee-spot-512.herokuapp.com/coffee/

## Approach: The MVC (Models, Views, Controllers) file structure was used to create an one model with all 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD. The online store app was deployed online via Heroku to allow for public access.

## Problem: Limited platform for high school students to show case their hand-made pottery, specifically mugs.

## Purpose: The app provides a platform to showcase their artistic skills and collect money to donate to local nonprofits.

## Targeted Users: Coffee mugs lovers and/or art lovers.

## Unsolved Problems: All of the planned functionality was successfully coded. There were some styling components that were abandoned - creating equal sized divs for products on the index route.

## Technologies Used:
###  *HTML
###  *CSS
###  *JavaScript
###  *jQuery
###  *Node.js
###  *Mongoose
###  *Express
###  *EJS
